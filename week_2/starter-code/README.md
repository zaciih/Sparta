# CSS - Basic Styling Lab

## Timings

30 - 45 Minutes

## Summary

You've been provided with the basic HTML for a profile page. You now need to apply what you've learned about CSS in order to style it to the brief below. **Remember to use the Chrome developer tools to identify elements and the styling they have!**

## Tasks

* Give the navbar a black background colour to stop the white Sparta Global logo from clashing with it.
* Resize the logo.
* Remove the bullet points and hyperlink styling from the navbar's list elements and make them white so they don't clash with the background.
* Move all the content a little closer into the centre of the page.
* Set the font to Raleway, with a default of sans-serif (**NOTE**: It will require a little research to figure out how to include this font)
* Resize the profile picture and put it in a nice, circular container.
* Resize the screenshots on the project page.
* Give all the h1 and h4 elements a colour of #E13A63

## Bonus Tasks

* See if you can figure out how to remove the empty space around the navbar and have it stretch all the way across the screen.
* Get the list elements in the navbar to turn grey when you hover the cursor over them to indicate that they've been selected.
* Try to get the list elements in the navbar to sit next to each other horizontally.
