Feature: Scenario Outline with data tables

Scenario Outline: Using an example table to make out tests drier and more dynamic

Given I have more than one data row in my table
And includes <Name> as a string and <Age> as an integer
Then I can validate <Name> and <Age> are correct

Examples:
  | Name  | Age |
  | Rob   | 28  |
  | Louis | 22  |
  | Ash   | 24  |
