Feature: Hooks and tags demo
  As a trainee
  I want to see how hooks and tags work
  So that I can use cucumber efficiently

  @test2
  Scenario: Check for a name
    Given I have a before hook in place with name details
    Then I can validate this information

  @test1
  Scenario: a 2nd Scenario which could be ran
    Given I use a tag
    Then only this test will run
